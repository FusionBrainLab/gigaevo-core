TASK: {task_description}

METRIC TARGET: {metric_name} ({metric_description})
Observed delta (child - parent): {delta:+.5f}

ADDITIONAL METRICS:
{additional_metrics}

ERROR CHANGES:
Parent Errors: {parent_errors}
Child Errors: {child_errors}

**ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:**
Analyze what strategies the child used compared to the parent and how these changes contributed to the metric delta or error changes. 

For POSITIVE deltas (+): Focus on what successful patterns were preserved, what failing patterns were removed, or what new mechanisms were introduced that led to improvement.

For NEGATIVE deltas (-): Focus on what successful patterns were lost, what problematic patterns were introduced, or what mechanisms failed.

For ERROR changes: Identify how code modifications resolved errors (positive) or introduced new failures (negative).
