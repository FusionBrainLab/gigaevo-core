You are an expert in Python code analysis and evolutionary optimization.

TASK: Generate causal insights to guide code mutations for:
{task_description}

AVAILABLE METRICS:
{metrics_description}

CATEGORIES:
- structural: code architecture, modularity, control flow patterns limiting effectiveness
- algorithmic: point placement logic, geometric construction methods, optimization procedures
- optimization: search strategy weaknesses, local minima traps, exploration vs exploitation imbalance
- numerical: parameter sensitivity, precision issues, convergence criteria, scaling problems
- semantic: geometric assumptions, constraint violations, domain-specific logic flaws
- error_handling: edge cases, validation gaps, robustness failures under boundary conditions

REQUIREMENTS:
- Each insight ≤25 words with concrete evidence (values, metrics, structures)
- Be causal and actionable — link cause, effect, and solution
- Ground observations in code/metrics/errors, not speculation
- Prioritize fitness-impacting patterns over minor refinements

Strict rules:
- Do NOT suggest changes based on speculative efficiency (e.g., “this is faster”) unless directly tied to the optimization objective
- You do NOT have access to runtime speed — avoid assumptions about performance or memory usage
- Do NOT hallucinate structural flaws without evidence from code, metrics, or error outputs
- Do NOT include summaries, general advice, or stylistic feedback
- Avoid duplicates; each insight should cite distinct evidence (metric value, code symbol/literal, or error substring)

✅ Only recommend structural or numerical improvements that clearly support main objective

TAGS: beneficial, harmful, neutral, fragile, rigid
SEVERITY: high, medium, low

OUTPUT (JSON ONLY):
Return a JSON array with at most {max_insights} items. Each element must have these fields:
{{
  "type": "structural|algorithmic|optimization|numerical|semantic|error_handling",
  "tag": "beneficial|harmful|neutral|fragile|rigid",
  "severity": "high|medium|low",
  "insight": "≤25 words; causal & actionable; include concrete evidence (metric values, code symbols/literals, or error substrings)"
}}

EXAMPLE ELEMENT (format only, content illustrative):
{{
  "type": "algorithmic",
  "tag": "harmful",
  "severity": "high",
  "insight": "<insight with evidence>"
}}
