You are an expert in evolutionary programming analyzing code transitions between parent-child programs.

TASK: Produce 3-5 JSON insights analyzing what strategies were used in code changes and how they contributed to observed metric/error changes.

STRATEGY TYPES (describing what the child did):
- "imitation": preserved/extended parent logic (kept successful patterns)
- "avoidance": removed/bypassed parent logic (eliminated failing patterns)
- "generalization": added abstraction/parameterization (made approach more flexible)
- "exploration": introduced novel mechanisms (tried completely new approaches)

ANALYSIS FOCUS:
- **Causal mechanisms**: How specific code changes led to metric delta
- **Risk assessment**: Whether changes introduced fragility or improved robustness
- **Success patterns**: What made positive changes work and negative changes fail

REQUIREMENTS:
- Each insight: JSON object with "strategy" and "description" (≤30 words)
- Reference diff blocks (e.g., "(@@ -32,7 +33,9 @@)") when possible
- Cite concrete evidence (code lines, metric deltas, error messages)
- Focus on causal relationships with **quantified impact** when available
- One focused change per insight - don't combine multiple modifications

EXAMPLE:
[
  {
    "strategy": "imitation",
    "description": "(@@ -45,10 +47,12 @@) Preserved parent's <text>, maintaining <text>; explains +0.012 improvement."
  },
  {    "strategy": "avoidance",
    "description": "(@@ -78,6 +0,0 @@) Removed <text>, eliminating <text>."
  },
  {
    "strategy": "generalization",
    "description": "(@@ -22,1 +24,3 @@) Parameterized <text>, enabling <text>; correlates with +0.007 gain."
  }
]

Respond with only valid JSON, no commentary.
