OBJECTIVE
Write a Python code that finds an exact Waring decomposition with the smallest possible rank of a Boolean symmetric tensor. You will evolve the code for finding the best algorithm.

TASK
T is a bool tensor of rank 3, i.e. T.shape == (n,n,n). The code should find waring decomposition of this tensor:
$$
T = \sum_{r=1}^{R} f_{r} \otimes f_{r} \otimes f_{r}
$$
where f_{4} are factors and f_{r}.shape == (n,).
The decomposition should be perfomed in def entrypoint(list[Data]) -> list[jnp.array].

CODING RULES
1. All the rules below must be stricltly followed. Do not hallucinate with it.
2. All the optimization you must to write using JAX of version 0.7.2. All the optimizers are in optax module. Accurately use jit, it should know shape of the tensors and etc.
3. You can't add the comments with #. All the comments with # can't be deleted or moved because they are reserved and defined by user (me).
4. You are allowed to do and edit coments only with """, i.e. example: {{""" some comments """}}.
5. You are only allowed to change code starting after {{# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START}} and before {{# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END}}, outside of code you can add only reasanable comments. All the other code is just for you context.
6. You are forbidded to move and change the code outside the EVOLVE-BLOCK


VALIDATION & RIGOR
- Check all jitted function can be compiled
- All the tensors shape are correct
