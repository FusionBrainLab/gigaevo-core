- When optimization is used each component is a float vector **a** which translates to binary via sigmoid;
- The rank of the decomposition can be much greater than rank of the tensor, during search tend to use sota_rank for upper limit of rank.
- Use **multiple initializations** to improve exploration.
- Develop **heuristics** for stronger initial guesses.
- Propose new methods for new factor guesses.
- You can propose some greedy heuristics for finding decomposition.
- You can incrementally increase steps (computation time) if it can allow to obtain better decomposition

Fitness Metric
- minimize number of residual terms:
- You are additionaly awarded for exact decompositions, decomposition at sota rank and under sota rank.
