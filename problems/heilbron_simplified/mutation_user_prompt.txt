EVOLUTIONARY MUTATION: Adaptive Code Evolution

Transform the program using program insights and historical lineage intelligence with intelligent exploration/exploitation balance.

## INTELLIGENCE INPUTS

**PROGRAM INSIGHTS**: category [tag] (severity): concrete evidence
- Categories: structural, algorithmic, optimization, numerical, semantic, error_handling
- Tags: beneficial, harmful, neutral, fragile, rigid
- Severity: high (direct fitness impact), medium (geometric reasoning), low (implementation details)

**TAG MEANINGS (evolutionary guidance)**:
- **beneficial**: Current pattern is good → PRESERVE/EXTEND this approach
- **harmful**: Current pattern is bad → REMOVE/AVOID this approach
- **fragile**: Current pattern is risky → IMPROVE/ROBUSTIFY this approach  
- **rigid**: Current pattern is inflexible → MAKE MORE ADAPTABLE
- **neutral**: Current pattern has no clear impact → IGNORE for evolution

**LINEAGE INSIGHTS**: Historical mutation outcomes and their measured effects
- strategy: imitation/generalization/avoidance/exploration (past action taken)
- description: causal explanation with quantified impact (≤30 words)
- delta: measured performance impact (relative change)
- diff: exact code modifications made

## EVOLUTIONARY ARCHETYPE SELECTION

Choose your evolutionary approach based on evidence strength and risk tolerance:

### EXPLOITATION ARCHETYPES (Evidence-Driven Refinement)
**When lineage shows consistent positive outcomes and strong beneficial insights:**

1. **Precision Optimization**
   → Fine-tune proven patterns, minimal risk changes, conservative improvements

2. **Proven Pattern Extension**
   → Replicate successful strategies, generalize working approaches, safe adaptations

3. **Harmful Pattern Removal**
   → Eliminate documented failure modes, clean up problematic code, defensive improvements

### EXPLORATION ARCHETYPES (Innovation-Driven Change)
**When lineage shows failures, weak evidence, or strong harmful/rigid insights:**

4. **Geometric Innovation**
   → Novel point arrangements, spatial reorganization, constraint-driven design

5. **Algorithmic Discovery**
   → New placement strategies, sampling methods, optimization flows

6. **Structural Synthesis**
   → Combine multiple approaches, hybrid architectures, emergent behaviors

### HYBRID ARCHETYPES (Balanced Approach)
**When evidence is mixed or moderate confidence:**

7. **Guided Innovation**
   → Preserve proven elements while introducing targeted improvements

8. **Conservative Exploration**
   → Explore within safe boundaries, maintain structural integrity

## ARCHETYPE SELECTION FRAMEWORK

**Evidence Assessment**:
- **Strong positive lineage** + **beneficial insights** → Choose Exploitation archetype
- **Weak/negative lineage** + **harmful/rigid insights** → Choose Exploration archetype  
- **Mixed evidence** + **moderate confidence** → Choose Hybrid archetype

**Risk Tolerance**:
- **High confidence** → Exploitation archetypes (1-3)
- **Low confidence** → Exploration archetypes (4-6)
- **Moderate confidence** → Hybrid archetypes (7-8)

**Select your archetype and justify in ≤1 sentence based on evidence strength and risk assessment.**

## EXECUTION PRINCIPLES

- **Evidence-driven**: 1-3 program insights from distinct categories required
- **Archetype-appropriate**: Match change scope to selected archetype
- **Historical guidance**: leverage lineage outcomes while allowing for innovation
- **Traceability**: link all changes to specific insights or lineage evidence
- **Prioritization**: severity first, then beneficial/fragile tags preferred
- **Delta preference**: favor strategies with positive historical outcomes
- **Tag-based action**: Use harmful insights to REMOVE patterns, beneficial/fragile to PRESERVE/IMPROVE patterns
- **Archetype constraints**: 
  - Exploitation: ≤2 small, localized changes
  - Exploration: Meaningful structural novelty required
  - Hybrid: Balance proven elements with targeted innovations

## OUTPUT

**Archetype Selection**: [Selected archetype] - [1 sentence justification]

**Justification** (2-3 sentences):
- Program insights: category [tag] (severity)
- Strategy selected + supporting evidence
- Expected mechanism of fitness improvement

**Code**:
```python
import numpy as np
# Additional used imports
def entrypoint():
    # Archetype-appropriate implementation
    # Set numpy.random.seed(42) if using randomness
    return points  # shape (11, 2) numpy array
```

**Critical**: Use exact format above. No text outside code fences.
