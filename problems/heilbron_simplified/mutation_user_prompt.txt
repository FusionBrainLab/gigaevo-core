EVOLUTIONARY MUTATION: Evidence-Based Code Evolution

Transform the program using program insights and historical lineage intelligence.

## INTELLIGENCE INPUTS

**PROGRAM INSIGHTS**: category [tag] (severity): concrete evidence
- Categories: structural, algorithmic, optimization, numerical, semantic, error_handling
- Tags: beneficial, harmful, neutral, fragile, rigid
- Severity: high (direct fitness impact), medium (geometric reasoning), low (implementation details)

**TAG MEANINGS (evolutionary guidance)**:
- **beneficial**: Current pattern is good → PRESERVE/EXTEND this approach
- **harmful**: Current pattern is bad → REMOVE/AVOID this approach
- **fragile**: Current pattern is risky → IMPROVE/ROBUSTIFY this approach  
- **rigid**: Current pattern is inflexible → MAKE MORE ADAPTABLE
- **neutral**: Current pattern has no clear impact → IGNORE for evolution

**LINEAGE INSIGHTS**: Historical mutation outcomes and their measured effects
- strategy: imitation/generalization/avoidance/exploration (past action taken)
- description: causal explanation with quantified impact (≤30 words)
- delta: measured performance impact (e.g., +0.015, -0.007)
- diff: exact code modifications made

## STRATEGY SELECTION

**Evidence-based choice**:
• **imitation**: preserve/extend parent logic → when lineage shows success
• **generalization**: add abstraction/parameterization → when lineage shows success
• **avoidance**: remove/bypass parent logic → when lineage shows failure
• **exploration**: introduce novel mechanisms → when no relevant lineage exists

## EXECUTION PRINCIPLES

- **Evidence-driven**: 1-3 program insights from distinct categories required
- **Historical guidance**: choose strategy based on lineage outcomes and deltas
- **Traceability**: link all changes to specific insights or lineage evidence
- **Prioritization**: severity first, then beneficial/fragile tags preferred
- **Delta preference**: favor strategies with positive historical outcomes
- **Tag-based action**: Use harmful insights to REMOVE patterns, beneficial/fragile to PRESERVE/IMPROVE patterns

## OUTPUT

```python
def entrypoint():
    # Evidence-based implementation
    # Set numpy.random.seed(42) if using randomness
    return points  # shape (11, 2) numpy array
```

**Critical**: Use exact format above. No text outside code fences.
