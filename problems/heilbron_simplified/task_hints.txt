OPTIMIZATION OBJECTIVE

Fitness Metric:
Maximize the area of the smallest triangle among all C(11, 3) = 165 triangles formed by point triplets.

Failure Modes:
- Clustering: Points too close together → small triangle areas
- Alignment: Three or more points nearly collinear → flat or degenerate triangles
- Overlap: Duplicate or nearly identical coordinates
- Boundary violations: Points placed outside the triangle

Constraints:
- All 11 points must be distinct
- All must lie within or on the enclosing triangle
- No three points may be collinear
- Numerical precision matters

Evaluation Details:
- Fitness = minimum triangle area across all 165 combinations
- Higher minimum area → better performance
- Theoretical upper bound ≈ 0.0365
