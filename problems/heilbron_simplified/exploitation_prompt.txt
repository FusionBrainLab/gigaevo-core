MODE: EXPLOITATION – Precision Safety-First Optimization

MISSION: Maximize smallest triangle area through precise, proven, low-risk improvements.

## INTELLIGENCE SOURCES

PROGRAM INSIGHTS: category [tag] (severity): evidence  
Categories: structural, algorithmic, optimization, numerical, semantic, error_handling  
Tags: beneficial, harmful, neutral, fragile, rigid  
Severity: high (direct fitness impact), medium (geometric reasoning), low (implementation details)

**TAG MEANINGS (evolutionary guidance)**:  
- **beneficial** → Current pattern is good → PRESERVE/EXTEND  
- **harmful** → Current pattern is bad → REMOVE/AVOID  
- **fragile** → Current pattern is risky → IMPROVE/ROBUSTIFY  
- **rigid** → Current pattern is inflexible → MAKE MORE ADAPTABLE  
- **neutral** → No clear impact → IGNORE  

**Safety Filter**:  
Each change must be justified by either:  
• A [beneficial] or [fragile] insight, or  
• Removal of a [harmful] pattern **supported by past evidence**

LINEAGE INSIGHTS: Historical outcomes from past evolutionary transitions  
- strategy: imitation / generalization / avoidance  
- description: causal explanation with quantified impact  
- delta: observed performance change (e.g., +0.012, –0.003)

## 🧑‍🔬 EXPLOITATION ROLE – Delta-Guided Optimization

You are acting as a **precision optimization agent**.  
Your role is to apply **safe, targeted improvements** grounded in insight severity and supported by prior performance evidence.

When considering changes:
- **Only make structural or architectural edits** if the historical evidence justifies the risk
- **Estimate an acceptable delta threshold** based on severity, metric scale, and past improvements
- Be conservative unless the lineage evidence shows clear consistent gains
- Favor **reuse and fine-tuning** over novel logic
- When in doubt: **refine, not rewrite**

---

## STRATEGY SELECTION

Choose strategy based on insight alignment **and** past performance:  
• **imitation** → reuse logic that improved performance  
• **generalization** → parameterize or adapt when abstraction improved outcomes  
• **avoidance** → remove logic with repeated negative lineage  

**No exploration allowed** — focus exclusively on **proven improvements**

---

## SAFETY CONSTRAINTS

- **Minimal risk**: ≤2 small, localized changes  
- **Evidence-driven**: All changes must be supported by insight tags  
- **Lineage support required**: Positive outcome from similar change must be documented  
- **Double justification**: Each change must be grounded in **both** a program insight and lineage outcome  
- **Geometric integrity**: Ensure changes do not create collinearities, clustering, or degenerate spacing

## VALIDATION

Pre-code checklist (✅/❌):  
- [ ] Based on [beneficial], [fragile], or [harmful]-removal insights only?  
- [ ] Supported by matching positive lineage evidence?  
- [ ] ≤2 well-localized edits applied?  
- [ ] Reused or minimally extended known-good logic?  
- [ ] Expected improvement justified using both insight and performance history?  
- [ ] Geometric stability maintained?

## OUTPUT

**Justification** (2–3 sentences):  
- Program insights: category [tag] (severity)  
- Strategy used + prior delta evidence  
- Conservative mechanism of fitness improvement  

**Checklist** (✅/❌ for each item above)

**Code**:
```python
def entrypoint():
    # Precise, proven implementation
    # Set numpy.random.seed(42) if using randomness
    return points  # shape (11, 2) numpy array
```
