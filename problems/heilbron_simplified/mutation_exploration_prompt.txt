MODE: EXPLORATION – Bold Structural Innovation

MISSION: Maximize smallest triangle area through bold architectural changes, geometric invention, or constraint-driven design innovation.

## INTELLIGENCE SOURCES

PROGRAM INSIGHTS: category [tag] (severity): evidence
Categories: structural, algorithmic, optimization, numerical, semantic, error_handling
Tags: beneficial, harmful, neutral, fragile, rigid
Severity: high (direct fitness impact), medium (geometric reasoning), low (implementation details)

**TAG MEANINGS (evolutionary guidance)**:
- **beneficial** → current pattern is good → PRESERVE/EXTEND this approach
- **harmful** → current pattern is bad → REMOVE/AVOID this approach
- **fragile** → current pattern is risky → IMPROVE/ROBUSTIFY this approach
- **rigid** → current pattern is inflexible → MAKE MORE ADAPTABLE
- **neutral** → pattern has no clear impact → IGNORE for evolution

LINEAGE INSIGHTS: Historical outcomes from prior evolutionary transitions
- strategy: imitation / generalization / avoidance / exploration
- description: causal explanation with quantified impact (≤30 words)
- delta: performance change (e.g., +0.023, –0.008)

## BOLD STRATEGY SELECTION

Choose strategy based on historical evidence:
• **imitation** → preserve/extend prior logic when lineage shows positive outcomes (Δ > +0.01)
• **generalization** → adapt or abstract known ideas when lineage shows this improves performance
• **avoidance** → bypass prior logic when lineage shows it caused degradation
• **exploration** → introduce novel methods when no lineage insight applies or prior logic consistently fails

**Innovation Mandate**:
Introduce substantial change — but avoid complexity for its own sake.
Favor bold yet coherent architectural or geometric innovations that challenge current limitations.
Avoid large rewrites unless justified by insight tags or lineage evidence.
Preserve and adapt working components unless explicitly marked [harmful] or [rigid].

## EXPLORATION ARCHETYPE SELECTOR

To focus your innovation, select one **exploration archetype**.
This does not prescribe specific logic — it identifies the style of change you are pursuing.

**Archetype Options**:

1. **Geometric Pattern Innovation**
   → Explore new point arrangements (e.g., symmetry-breaking, spatial variation, layout reorganization)

2. **Placement & Sampling Strategy**
   → Change how points are initialized, seeded, or distributed (e.g., structured noise, adaptive sampling, low-discrepancy layouts)

3. **Optimization & Refinement Flow**
   → Redesign how candidate configurations are refined (e.g., local updates, iterative relaxations, indirect metric targeting)

4. **Constraint-Oriented Mutation**
   → Introduce, remove, or adapt constraints (e.g., distance, angle, boundary conditions) to provoke novel behavior

5. **Hybrid Composition**
   → Synthesize elements from multiple prior approaches into a unified system with new interaction dynamics

State your chosen archetype and explain its rationale in ≤1 sentence.

## INNOVATION REQUIREMENTS

- **Meaningful structural or spatial novelty required**: modify architecture, distribution logic, refinement flows, or placement design
- **Insight-driven**: apply 1–3 program insights from distinct categories
- **Calculated risk**: ≤2 high-severity insights; prioritize based on severity and novelty potential
- **Strategy grounded in history**: select mutation type (exploration, imitation, etc.) using lineage deltas
- **Traceability**: link all changes to insights or historical evidence
- **Geometric reasoning**: consider point spacing, angle constraints, area distribution, and failure patterns
- **Tag-based logic**: REMOVE harmful patterns, ADAPT rigid ones, PRESERVE/IMPROVE beneficial or fragile ones

## VALIDATION

Pre-code checklist (✅/❌):
- [ ] Does the mutation introduce **nontrivial change** (structural, geometric, or algorithmic)?
- [ ] Is the scope of change **proportional to insight severity**?
- [ ] Are 1–3 concrete insights from distinct categories used?
- [ ] Are ≤2 high-severity insights invoked?
- [ ] Is the chosen mutation strategy backed by lineage delta or absence of guidance?
- [ ] Are **prior beneficial patterns preserved or adapted**, unless marked harmful/rigid?
- [ ] Is the expected geometric/fitting improvement clearly articulated?

## OUTPUT

**Justification** (2–3 sentences):
- Program insights: category [tag] (severity)
- Strategy selected + supporting delta (if available)
- Expected mechanism of fitness improvement

**Checklist** (✅/❌ for each item above)

**Code**:
```python
import numpy as np
# Additional used imports
def entrypoint():
    # Bold exploratory implementation
    # Set numpy.random.seed(42) if using randomness
    return points  # shape (11, 2) numpy array
```
