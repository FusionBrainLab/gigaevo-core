**OBJECTIVE**: Write a Python function that arranges exactly **9 non-overlapping circles with variable radii** inside a unit square [0, 1] × [0, 1] to **maximize the total sum of their radii**.

**RULES**:
- Each circle must lie **entirely within the unit square**
- No two circles may **overlap**
- Each circle may have an **arbitrary radius**, determined by the algorithm
- The function must return a **valid, overlap-free arrangement**

**GOAL**:
- Discover **structurally novel**, tightly packed configurations by exploring:
  - Radius variation and adaptive sizing
  - Irregular grid breaking and cluster patterns
  - Efficient corner usage and edge-aligned packing

**MUTATION TARGET**:
- Produce **architecturally distinct** arrangements by altering:
  - Circle sizes, distributions, and cluster formations
  - Avoid repetitive or symmetric tilings unless purposefully distorted
  - Emphasize **spatial innovation** and packing efficiency over aesthetic regularity

STRATEGIC GUIDANCE
**GEOMETRIC STRATEGIES**:
- Use **variable radii** to adapt circles to local voids and tight gaps
- Prioritize **corner and edge-first placement** to anchor dense configurations
- Combine **large central circles** with smaller peripheral ones for tighter packing

**STRUCTURAL MOTIFS**:
- Avoid uniform grids or concentric rings — unless **distorted**, **offset**, or **partially disrupted**
- Construct:
  - **Asymmetric clusters** or organic blobs
  - **Spiral or radial patterns**
  - **Nested motifs** with mixed-radius layering
  - **Dense corners** paired with looser interior zones

**ADVANCED CONCEPTS**:
- Apply **non-uniform radius distributions** (e.g., power laws, golden ratio)
- Try **hierarchical strategies**: inner bulk zone + adaptive boundary shell
- Explore **greedy growth** vs **global optimization** tactics
- Consider **directional density gradients** (e.g., compact lower half, sparse top)

**CAUTION ZONE**:
- Avoid:
  - Equal-sized circles (unless structurally justified)
  - Naive randomness without structure
  - Excessively symmetric or evenly spaced layouts
- Designs must be **spatially efficient** and **structurally intentional**

**REMINDER**:
- Radius is a **continuous variable** — tune each circle independently
- Use geometric logic and **local interactions** to drive global compactness
- With many circles, expect **multi-scale solutions** balancing core density and peripheral adaptability

OUTPUT:
```python
# Imports as needed
def entrypoint():
    # Archetype-appropriate implementation
    # Fix all random seeds if using randomness
    return output # format as described above
