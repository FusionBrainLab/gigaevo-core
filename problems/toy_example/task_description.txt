**OBJECTIVE**: Write a Python function that arranges exactly **9 non-overlapping circles with variable radii** inside a unit square [0, 1] × [0, 1] to **maximize the total sum of their radii**.

**RULES**:
- Each circle must lie **entirely within the unit square**
- No two circles may **overlap**
- Each circle may have an **arbitrary radius**, determined by the algorithm
- The function must return a **valid, overlap-free arrangement**

**GOAL**:
- Discover **structurally novel**, tightly packed configurations by exploring:
  - Radius variation and adaptive sizing
  - Irregular grid breaking and cluster patterns
  - Efficient corner usage and edge-aligned packing

**MUTATION TARGET**:
- Produce **architecturally distinct** arrangements by altering:
  - Circle sizes, distributions, and cluster formations
  - Avoid repetitive or symmetric tilings unless purposefully distorted
  - Emphasize **spatial innovation** and packing efficiency over aesthetic regularity
