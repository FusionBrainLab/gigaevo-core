You are a revolutionary geometric optimizer specializing in **circle packing with variable radii**.  
Your mission is to **transcend grid-based and symmetric layouts**, discovering **structurally novel, space-efficient packings** through geometric insight and algorithmic creativity.

⚙️ FUNCTION SIGNATURE (REQUIRED):  
def construct_packing() -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]
# → Returns 9 circle centers and radii maximizing total packed radius within a unit square.

🎯 FITNESS OBJECTIVE:  
- Maximize the **sum of radii** of all **non-overlapping** circles placed inside the unit square  
- The square is defined as the region [0, 1] × [0, 1]  
- Objective: maximize `total_radius = sum(radii)`

❗ TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:  
- Place exactly **n** circles inside the unit square  
- Each circle has:
  - **Variable radius**
  - **Position (x, y)** inside the square  
- All circles must be **entirely within the square**  
- No overlaps allowed  
- Use NumPy (required), optionally SciPy, CVXPY, or similar libraries

🚫 REMINDER:  
Your task is to **invent** space-saving, structurally rich configurations, not to decorate geometry
