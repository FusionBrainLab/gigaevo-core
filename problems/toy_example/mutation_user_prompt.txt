🔬 MUTATION MANDATE:
You are given one or more **input programs for crossover**, along with:
- Their metrics  
- Structured insights  
- Lineage history  

Your task is to write a new **mutant program** that:
- Integrates at least **two insights** from different domains  
- Uses at least one **lineage-based insight** (imitation, generalization, or avoidance)  
- Applies a **clearly traceable architectural change** — not a parameter tweak  

📚 INSIGHT SOURCES:

### 💡 PROGRAM INSIGHTS (categorized):
These may include:
- **geometric** (e.g., layout conflicts, nesting logic)  
- **algorithmic** (e.g., perturbation flaws, annealing design)  
- **evolutionary** (e.g., stagnation, trend shifts)  
- **mathematical** (e.g., spacing bounds, angle symmetries)  
- **implementation** (e.g., init heuristics, overlap handling)

### 🧬 LINEAGE HISTORY (performance deltas):
Each entry includes:
- A fitness delta (e.g., "–0.132", "+0.280")  
- A structural explanation (e.g., "spiral chain improved packing", "rigid angle cluster failed")

You must:
- Reflect on at least one **improvement** and one **degradation**  
- Decide whether to **imitate**, **avoid**, or **generalize** a prior strategy  
- Summarize the lineage insight in a `Lineage (type): ...` comment line

✍️ OUTPUT FORMAT — STRICT:

Output **only a single fenced Python code block** (```python ... ```), with:
- A single entry point: `construct_packing()`
- Other functions as needed
- **No docstrings, no markdown, no explanation, no extra comments**

🔖 The code must begin with a **4-line structured comment block**, exactly as shown:
```python
# Insight (geometric): ...
# Insight (algorithmic): ...
# Lineage (avoidance): ...
# Design: ...
```

✅ RULES:
- Use provided helper functions where appropriate  
- Do **not** output anything outside the code block  
- No explanation, markdown, or extra formatting

🤔 THINK BEFORE CODING:
- What failed in the parent(s)?
- What succeeded?
- What **new** spatial, structural, or mathematical idea are you trying?
- Can the code structure reveal that idea clearly?

🧬 CANDIDATE INPUT PROGRAMS FOR CROSSOVER:

You are given {count} structurally distinct programs selected for recombination.  
These are **not guaranteed to be direct parents** in the mutation lineage.

Use their **combined insights** — not necessarily their code — to guide your mutant design.  
You may **discard, reimagine, or fuse architectural patterns** freely in pursuit of better packing.

At least one **true lineage-based insight** (from history) must also be integrated and reflected in the output comment.
