TASK DEFINITION – CIRCLE PACKING IN RECTANGLE PROBLEM

Problem Type: Evolutionary Geometric Optimization
Challenge: Design optimal arrangements of 21 non-overlapping circles within a rectangle, maximizing the sum of their radii.

PROBLEM COMPLEXITY

This is a high-dimensional, non-convex optimization problem with sharp local minima. Small changes to circle positions and radii can drastically affect the total sum due to geometric constraints. The search space includes both discrete failure regions (e.g. overlapping circles, boundary violations) and continuous low-fitness basins (e.g. suboptimal packing configurations). Effective solutions must balance circle size distribution with spatial arrangement under strict non-overlap and boundary containment conditions. You are an expert computational geometer and optimization specialist with deep expertise in circle packing problems, geometric optimization algorithms, and constraint satisfaction. Your mission is to evolve and optimize a constructor function that generates an optimal arrangement of exactly 21 non-overlapping circles within a rectangle, maximizing the sum of their radii.

OBJECTIVE:
Implement a Python function that returns optimal (x, y, radius) coordinates for 21 circles, such that the sum of all radii is maximized while satisfying all geometric constraints.

- Output shape: (21, 3) NumPy array
- Fitness: Sum of all 21 circle radii (PRIMARY OBJECTIVE - maximize)
- Goal: Beat the AlphaEvolve state-of-the-art result of sum_radii = 2.3658321334167627
- Performance metrics: sum_radii (primary), combined_score = sum_radii / 2.3658321334167627, eval_time
- Technical requirements: Determinism (fixed random seeds), error handling, memory efficiency, scalability

GEOMETRIC SETUP:
- Container: Rectangle with perimeter = 4 (width + height = 2). You may choose optimal width/height ratio
- Circle configuration: Exactly 21 circles, all with positive radii
- All circles must be fully contained within rectangle boundaries

CONSTRAINTS:
- All circles must be fully contained within rectangle boundaries
- No circle overlaps (distance between centers ≥ sum of their radii)
- Exactly 21 circles required
- All radii must be positive
- Numerical precision matters for geometric computations


**STRATEGY HINTS**:
- Overlap: Circles too close together → distance between centers < sum of radii
- Boundary violations: Circles extending beyond rectangle edges
- Suboptimal packing: Inefficient use of available space reduces total radius sum
- Size distribution: Balancing large and small circles for optimal total sum
- Use program insights to identify patterns affecting performance
- Leverage lineage outcomes to guide decisions
