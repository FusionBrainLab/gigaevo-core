**OBJECTIVE**: Write a Python function that learns a regression model from given training data (X_train, y_train) and uses it to predict the target values for unseen inputs X_test.

**RULES**:
The constructed function must:
- Accept a dictionary containing X_train, y_train, and X_test as inputs
- Output an array y_test of predicted values, matching the shape of X_test
- The implementation may use any suitable regression technique (e.g., linear, tree-based, neural networks)

**GOAL**:

Discover accurate and generalizable regression strategies by leveraging:
- Robust feature–target relationships
- Effective regularization
- Generalization to the hidden test set

**MUTATION TARGET**:

- Create architecturally distinct regression models via:
- Model structure changes (e.g. ensemble, kernel-based, nonlinear transforms)
- Preprocessing pipeline modifications
- Loss function or optimization strategy variation
- Reject trivial variations unless they contribute clear performance or structural innovation

STRATEGIC GUIDANCE
🔍 REGRESSION STRATEGY HINTS

**FEATURE ENGINEERING STRATEGIES**:
- Apply **nonlinear transformations** (e.g., log, polynomial, interaction terms) to uncover hidden patterns
- Normalize or scale inputs to improve model convergence and stability
- Exploit **local feature interactions** to capture region-specific trends in the data

**MODEL STRUCTURES & MOTIFS**:
- Avoid default regressors (plain linear, unregularized trees) — unless **enhanced**, **stacked**, or **adaptively tuned**
- Construct:
  - **Ensemble models** (e.g., bagging, boosting, stacking)
  - **Feature-wise subnetworks** (e.g., per-feature MLPs or attention heads)
  - **Residual pipelines** (e.g., baseline + correction)
  - **Multi-phase regressors** with coarse and fine predictors
- Use **sub-model reuse** creatively: train partial regressors on subsets of features and integrate their outputs

**ADVANCED CONCEPTS**:
- Favor **error-first modeling**: handle outliers or boundary cases explicitly before bulk regression
- Explore **layered modeling**: use one model to detect data regime, another to fit target
- Consider **hierarchical regression**: coarse predictor followed by localized refinements

**CAUTION ZONE**:
- Avoid:
  - Copy-paste templates with fixed parameters
  - Purely random feature selection
  - Overuse of regularization without justification
- Designs must be **interpretable** and **generalizable**

**REMINDER**:
- Regression is a **flexible optimization problem**
- Use feature and error reasoning to justify model design: bias–variance tradeoff, residual clustering, functional nonlinearity
- For complex datasets, expect multi-model arrangements with staged or modular designs
- Only subtle architectural innovation may push past standard baselines
