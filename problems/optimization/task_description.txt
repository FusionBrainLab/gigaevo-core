**OBJECTIVE**: Write a Python function that learns a regression model from given training data (X_train, y_train) and uses it to predict the target values for unseen inputs X_test.

**RULES**:
The constructed function must:
- Accept a dictionary containing X_train, y_train, and X_test as inputs
- Output an array y_test of predicted values, matching the shape of X_test
- The implementation may use any suitable regression technique (e.g., linear, tree-based, neural networks)

**GOAL**:

Discover accurate and generalizable regression strategies by leveraging:
- Robust feature–target relationships
- Effective regularization
- Generalization to the hidden test set

**MUTATION TARGET**:

- Create architecturally distinct regression models via:
- Model structure changes (e.g. ensemble, kernel-based, nonlinear transforms)
- Preprocessing pipeline modifications
- Loss function or optimization strategy variation
- Reject trivial variations unless they contribute clear performance or structural innovation
