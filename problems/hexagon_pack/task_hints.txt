**GEOMETRIC STRATEGIES**:
- Use **arbitrary rotations** to nest hexagons more efficiently along walls or in corners
- Align flat sides with edges or use tips to wedge into acute spaces
- Exploit **local adjacency** (edge-to-edge, vertex-to-vertex) to reduce voids

**STRUCTURAL MOTIFS**:
- Avoid regular grids, rings, or mirrored layouts — unless **deformed**, **twisted**, or **partially broken**
- Construct:
  - **Spiral chains** (e.g., golden angle)
  - **Fan or arc layouts**
  - **Asymmetric clusters** or nested patterns
  - **Multi-layer arrangements** with central core and outer ring
- Use **motif reuse** creatively: rotate and embed microstructures (e.g., 3-hex triangle, 5-hex cluster) in different contexts

**ADVANCED CONCEPTS**:
- Apply irrational rotations (π/φ, √2, etc.) to disrupt regularity
- Favor **boundary-first design**: trace edges before filling center
- Explore **layered geometry** (e.g., outer ring warped against inner spine)
- Consider **hierarchical packing**: tight inner clusters surrounded by optimized boundary elements

**CAUTION ZONE**:
- Avoid:
  - Identical rotations
  - Scatter-based randomness
  - Overuse of symmetry or uniform spacing
- Designs must be **locally coherent** and **globally compact**

**REMINDER**:
- Rotation is a **continuous optimization tool**
- Use geometric reasoning to justify layout: angle logic, adjacency, spatial compression
- With 11 hexagons, expect complex multi-level arrangements with both inner and outer structures
