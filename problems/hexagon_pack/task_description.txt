TASK DEFINITION – HEXAGON PACKING PROBLEM (11 UNIT HEXAGONS)

Challenge: Pack exactly 11 non-overlapping unit regular hexagons inside a regular enclosing hexagon to minimize the enclosing hexagon's side length. Hexagons may be placed and rotated arbitrarily in 2D.

OBJECTIVE
Arrange 11 unit regular hexagons (circumradius = 1.0) inside a minimal flat-topped regular enclosing hexagon centered at origin, such that:
1) (Non-overlap) All hexagons are strictly non-overlapping (minimum separation ≥ 0)
2) (Containment) All hexagons lie completely inside the enclosing hexagon
3) (Minimality) The enclosing hexagon's side length is minimized

Output: Tuple of (centers, angles)  |  Fitness: -side_length  |  Goal: side_length ≤ 3.93

CONSTRAINTS
- Exactly 11 unit regular hexagons with circumradius = 1.0
- Enclosing hexagon: regular, flat-topped, centered at (0, 0)
- All 11 hexagons fully contained inside enclosing hexagon
- No overlaps between any pair of hexagons

VALIDATION & EFFICIENCY (CRITICAL)
- Verify all 11 hexagons are non-overlapping using pairwise collision detection
- Check all hexagon vertices lie inside enclosing boundary
- For flat-topped regular hexagon: vertices at angles [0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300°] from center

FAILURE MODES
- Overlapping hexagons; hexagons extending outside enclosing boundary
- Incorrect hexagon geometry (wrong circumradius or vertex positions)
- Non-flat-topped enclosing hexagon; wrong number of hexagons (≠ 11)
- Not returning tuple format or wrong array shapes

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Implement `def entrypoint():` that returns a tuple (centers, angles):
- centers: (11, 2) NumPy float array of hexagon center coordinates (x, y)
- angles: (11,) NumPy float array of rotation angles in radians [0, 2π)
- Use numpy, scipy, sklearn, or standard library as needed
- Fix random seeds if using randomness (e.g., np.random.seed(42))
