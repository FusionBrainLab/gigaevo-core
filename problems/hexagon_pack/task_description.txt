**OBJECTIVE**: Write a Python function that arranges exactly 11 **non-overlapping** unit regular hexagons inside a larger enclosing regular hexagon (flat top/bottom, centered at the origin) to **minimize the enclosing hexagon's side length**.

**RULES**:
- Hexagons may be placed and **rotated arbitrarily** in 2D space
- The enclosing hexagon is:
  - Regular
  - Centered at (0, 0)
  - Flat top and bottom edges
- The function must return a **valid, overlap-free arrangement**

**GOAL**:
- Discover structurally novel, space-efficient packings by leveraging:
  - Irregular orientation
  - Cluster variation
  - Strategic boundary interaction

**MUTATION TARGET**:
- Create **architecturally distinct** configurations using placement, rotation, or layout motif change
- Reject traditional layouts unless transformed by a structural twist (e.g. offset rings, twisted grids, broken symmetry)
