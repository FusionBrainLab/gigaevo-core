⚙️ FUNCTION SIGNATURE (REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT):

def entrypoint() -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]
# → Returns 11 non-overlapping hexagon centers and angles to minimize enclosing hexagon size.

# 🧰 HELPER FUNCTIONS AVAILABLE IN helper.py:
get_hexagon_vertices(center: np.ndarray (2,), angle: float, side: float) -> np.ndarray (6, 2)
# → Returns the 6 vertices of a rotated regular hexagon.

check_hexagon_overlap_many(centers: np.ndarray (N, 2), angles: np.ndarray (N,)) -> bool
# → Returns True if any hexagons overlap.

check_hexagon_overlap_two(center1: np.ndarray (2,), angle1: float, center2: np.ndarray (2,), angle2: float) -> bool
# → Returns True if the two hexagons overlap.

compute_outer_hex_side_length(centers: np.ndarray (N, 2), angles: np.ndarray (N,), unit_side: float) -> float
# → Computes side length of smallest enclosing regular hexagon.


🎯 FITNESS OBJECTIVE:
- Minimize the side length of the **smallest enclosing regular hexagon**, centered at the origin
- Optimization is measured as the **negative** of the side length (so, higher is better)
- Known best: ≈ –3.942  for 11 hexagons expect roughly –10.0 to –3.94

❗ TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Place exactly 11 **unit** regular hexagons
- Each hexagon may be **arbitrarily rotated**
- **No overlaps allowed**
- The enclosing hexagon is:
  - **Regular**
  - **Centered** at the origin
  - With **flat top and bottom edges**
- Use NumPy (required), optionally SciPy, CVXPY, or similar libraries

🚫 REMINDER:
You are not here to decorate geometry — your task is to **invent** it through structural insight, spatial compression, and novel design motifs.
