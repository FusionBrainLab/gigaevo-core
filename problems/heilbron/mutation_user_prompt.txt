🔬 MUTATION MANDATE:
You are given one or more **input programs for crossover**, along with:
- Their metrics  
- Structured insights  
- Lineage history (ascendants and descendants)

Your task is to write a new mutant program that:
- Integrates **1 - 3 distinct insights** from different domains  
- Incorporates **a single lineage-based** strategy: imitation, generalization, or avoidance  
- Introduces a clearly identifiable **architectural or algorithmic modification** 
- Adjusts parameters only **when justified by an insight** (e.g., improved spacing, smarter perturbation)  
- Ensures each insight results in a **concrete, traceable change** in the code  
- Emulates a **surgical diff**: targeted, meaningful edits without rewriting unrelated logic

📚 INSIGHT SOURCES:

### 💡 PROGRAM INSIGHTS (categorized):
Examples include:
- **geometric**: triplet conflicts, degeneracy near edges or vertices  
- **algorithmic**: layout heuristics, point placement schemes  
- **evolutionary**: stagnation, fitness regression, mode collapse  
- **mathematical**: symmetry patterns, area scaling, triangle degeneracy  
- **implementation**: randomization schemes, projection, revalidation  
- **error**: invalid placements, outside-triangle points, collapsed triplets  

### 🧬 LINEAGE HISTORY (performance deltas):
Each entry includes:
- A fitness delta (e.g., "+0.0019", "–0.0142")  
- An explanation of structural success or failure (e.g., "edge-aligned triplet collapsed", "clustered spiral improved area") 

You must:
- Reflect on at least one **improvement** and one **degradation**  
- Choose whether to **imitate**, **avoid**, or **generalize** a prior strategy  
- Summarize the lineage insight in a single `Lineage (type): ...` comment line

✍️ OUTPUT FORMAT — STRICT:

Output **only a single fenced Python code block** (```python ... ```), with:
- A single entry point: `entrypoint()`
- Other functions as needed
- **No docstrings, no markdown, no explanation, no extra comments**

🔖 The code must begin with a **structured comment block**, exactly as shown:
```python
# Insight (geometric): ...
# Insight (algorithmic): ...
# Insight (error): ...
# Lineage (avoidance): ...
# Design: ...
```

⚠️ DO NOT write anything outside the code block.
⚠️ If randomization is used, you **MUST** fix the seeds at the start 

🧬 CROSSOVER INPUT:

You are given {count} structurally distinct programs selected for recombination.  
These are **not guaranteed to be direct parents** in the mutation lineage.
Use their **combined insights** to guide your mutant design.

Unless a complete rewrite is necessary, **preserve the structure** of the parent program and modify only specific parts.

✅ You may:
- Reuse or adapt helper functions
- Tune constants where appropriate
- Use # MUTATED to annotate key modified lines

🚫 Do NOT:
- Reindent or shuffle unrelated code  
- Perform cosmetic refactors  
- Rewrite the entire program without strong justification
