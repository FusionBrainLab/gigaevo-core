🔬 MUTATION MANDATE:
You are given one or more **input programs for crossover**, along with:
- Their performance metrics
- Structured insights
- Structured lineage insights (including from ancestors and descendants)

Your task is to write a new **mutant program** that:
- Integrates **1–3 distinct insights** from different domains
- Applies exactly **one lineage strategy**: imitation, generalization, or avoidance
- Introduces a **clearly identifiable algorithmic or architectural modification**
- Performs **parameter changes only when explicitly justified by an insight**
- Ensures that **each selected insight leads to a concrete, traceable code change**

---
📚 INSIGHT SOURCES:

### 💡 PROGRAM INSIGHTS (categorized):
Examples include:
- **geometric** (e.g., layout conflicts, nesting logic)
- **algorithmic** (e.g., perturbation flaws, annealing design)
- **evolutionary** (e.g., stagnation, trend shifts)
- **mathematical** (e.g., spacing bounds, angle symmetries)
- **implementation** (e.g., init heuristics, overlap handling)
- **error** (e.g., degenerate configuration)

### 🧠 LINEAGE INSIGHTS:

🧠 INSIGHT FORMAT:
Each insight includes:
- `strategy`: how to treat the code change (`imitation`, `avoidance`, or `generalization`)
- `description`: brief explanation of the likely effect
- `impact`: the metric delta caused by the change (e.g., `+0.019`)
- `diff`: a minimal unified diff representing the original change (for reference)
- `parent_reference` / `child_reference`: code location and snippet (if available)

Use these insights to:
- Understand specific past modifications
- Selectively reuse or avoid patterns
- Guide **targeted edits** in your new mutant

---

✍️ OUTPUT FORMAT — STRICT:

Produce **only a single fenced Python code block**:

```python
# Must include an `entrypoint()` function
# May define additional helpers
```

- Do **not** include explanations, comments, docstrings, or markdown
- Do **not** include anything outside the code block
- If randomness is used, **set a fixed seed** for reproducibility
- You may optionally annotate changes with `# MUTATED`

---

🎯 STRATEGIC MINDSET:

Your edits should emulate a **surgical diff**:
- Modify only the regions motivated by selected insights
- Do not reformat, shuffle, or rewrite unrelated logic
- Preserve structure and flow unless a complete overhaul is explicitly justified

---

🧬 CROSSOVER CONTEXT:

You are provided with `{count}` structurally diverse crossover candidates.

✅ You may:
- Reuse helper functions
- Tune constants with justification
- Insert new logic when guided by insights

🚫 Do NOT:
- Introduce cosmetic edits
- Reindent or shuffle unrelated code
- Rewrite the whole program without clear rationale
