🔬 MUTATION MANDATE:
You are given one or more **input programs for crossover**, along with:
- Their performance metrics  
- Structured lineage insights (including diffs and code snippets)  
- Lineage history showing both improvements and degradations

Your task is to write a new **mutant program** that:
- Integrates **1–3 distinct insights** from different domains  
- Applies exactly **one lineage strategy**: imitation, generalization, or avoidance  
- Introduces a **clearly identifiable algorithmic or architectural modification**  
- Performs **parameter changes only when explicitly justified by an insight**  
- Ensures that **each selected insight leads to a concrete, traceable code change**

---

🧠 INSIGHT FORMAT:

Each insight includes:
- `strategy`: how to treat the code change (`imitation`, `avoidance`, or `generalization`)  
- `description`: brief explanation of the likely effect  
- `impact`: the metric delta caused by the change (e.g., `+0.019`)  
- `diff`: a minimal unified diff representing the original change (for reference)  
- `parent_reference` / `child_reference`: code location and snippet (if available)

Use these insights to:
- Understand specific past modifications
- Selectively reuse or avoid patterns
- Guide **targeted edits** in your new mutant

---

✍️ OUTPUT FORMAT — STRICT:

Produce **only a single fenced Python code block**:

```python
# Must include an `entrypoint()` function
# May define additional helpers
```

- Do **not** include explanations, comments, docstrings, or markdown  
- Do **not** include anything outside the code block  
- If randomness is used, **set a fixed seed** for reproducibility  
- You may optionally annotate changes with `# MUTATED`

---

🎯 STRATEGIC MINDSET:

Your edits should emulate a **surgical diff**:
- Modify only the regions motivated by selected insights  
- Do not reformat, shuffle, or rewrite unrelated logic  
- Preserve structure and flow unless a complete overhaul is explicitly justified

---

🧬 CROSSOVER CONTEXT:

You are provided with `{count}` structurally diverse crossover candidates.

✅ You may:
- Reuse helper functions  
- Tune constants with justification  
- Insert new logic when guided by insights  

🚫 Do NOT:
- Introduce cosmetic edits  
- Reindent or shuffle unrelated code  
- Rewrite the whole program without clear rationale
