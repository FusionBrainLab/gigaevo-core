TASK DEFINITION – HEILBRONN TRIANGLE PROBLEM (11 POINTS)

Challenge: High-dimensional non-convex geometric optimization. Place 11 distinct points inside a unit-area equilateral triangle to maximize the smallest triangle area formed by any three points. Target: min_area ≥ 0.0365

OBJECTIVE
Return 11 distinct 2D coordinates inside a unit-area equilateral triangle such that:
1) (Containment) All points lie inside or on the boundary of the enclosing triangle
2) (Distinctness) All points are distinct (no duplicates)
3) (Non-degeneracy) No three points are collinear
4) (Maximality) The minimum area among all C(11,3) = 165 triangles is maximized

Output: (11, 2) NumPy array  |  Fitness: min_triangle_area  |  Goal: min_triangle_area ≥ 0.0365

CONSTRAINTS
- Enclosing triangle: equilateral, area = 1.0, flat-bottomed, base along x-axis, apex at (0, 0)
- Exactly 11 distinct points, all within or on boundary
- No collinear triplets (all 165 triangles must have non-zero area)

FAILURE MODES
- Point clustering (small triangle areas); nearly collinear triplets (flat triangles)
- Duplicate or overlapping coordinates; boundary violations (points outside triangle)
- Incorrect enclosing triangle geometry (wrong area, orientation, or vertices)
- Float precision errors causing false collinearity detection

HELPER FUNCTIONS
- `get_unit_triangle()` -> tuple of 3 arrays (A, B, C), each shape (2,) - vertices of unit-area triangle
- `get_smallest_triangle_area(coordinates)` -> float - minimum area among all C(n,3) triangles
  - Input: (n, 2) array, Output: scalar float
- `is_inside_triangle(points, a, b, c)` -> bool - True if all points inside/on triangle boundary
  - Input: points (n, 2), vertices a,b,c each (2,), Output: bool
These are available as import from `helper.py`

PROBLEM COMPLEXITY
This is a non-convex optimization problem with sharp local minima. Small coordinate changes can drastically reduce minimum area due to geometric degeneracies. The search space includes discrete failure regions (exact alignments) and continuous low-fitness basins (clustered configurations). Solutions must balance global dispersion with local spacing under strict boundary constraints.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Implement `def entrypoint():` that returns a (11, 2) NumPy array:
- Shape: (11, 2) array of point coordinates (x, y)
- All points inside unit-area equilateral triangle (flat-bottomed, apex at origin)
- Use numpy, scipy, sklearn, or standard library as needed
- Fix random seeds if using randomness (e.g., np.random.seed(42))
- Return type: np.ndarray with dtype float32, shape (11, 2)
