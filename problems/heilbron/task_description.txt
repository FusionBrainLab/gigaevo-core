Design a function that returns **11 2D points** lying **on or inside** a **unit-area equilateral triangle** such that the **area of the smallest triangle** formed by any three points is **maximized**.

📐 TRIANGLE SPECIFICATION:
- Equilateral with unit area
- Flat base along the X-axis
- One vertex fixed at (0, 0)
- Triangle points upward

🧮 OBJECTIVE:
Among all \\( \\binom{11}{3} = 165 \\) triangles that can be formed, find the layout where the **smallest of these triangle areas is as large as possible**.

This is a variant of the **Heilbronn Triangle Problem**.

⚠️ CONSTRAINTS:
- All 11 points must be **distinct**
- No three points may be exactly **collinear** or positioned so their triangle area is 0
