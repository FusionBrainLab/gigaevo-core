🧠 TASK DEFINITION – HEILBRONN TRIANGLE PROBLEM

Design a Python function that returns exactly 11 distinct 2D points lying inside or on a unit-area equilateral triangle (area=1) such that the area of the smallest triangle formed by any three of these points is as large as possible.

📐 TRIANGLE GEOMETRY

- The enclosing triangle is:
  - Equilateral
  - Unit area
  - Has one vertex at (0, 0)
  - Base lies along the X-axis
  - Points upward (flat-bottomed orientation)

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Among all \\( \\binom{11}{3} = 165 \\) triangles formed by selecting any 3 of the 11 points:

→ Maximize the area of the smallest triangle.

This means:
- No triangle formed by any triplet should be too small
- Avoid geometric degeneracies like flat or needle-thin triangles

⚠️ CONSTRAINTS

- All points must be distinct (no duplicates or overlaps)
- No three points may be exactly collinear
- All points must lie within or on the boundary of the enclosing triangle
