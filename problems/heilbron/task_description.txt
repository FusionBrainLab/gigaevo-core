**OBJECTIVE**: Write a Python function that arranges exactly 11 points on or inside a unit-area equilateral triangle so that the area of the smallest triangle formed by any three points is maximized.

**RULES**:
- The enclosing triangle:
  - Is equilateral (all sides and angles equal)
  - Has unit area
  - Has its base on the X-axis, with one vertex at (0, 0) and the triangle extending upward
- Points may be placed anywhere inside or on the triangle
- The function must return a valid configuration of 11 points in 2D space

**GOAL**:
- Discover spatial arrangements that maximize the smallest triangle area by leveraging:
  - Non-uniform spacing
  - Edge utilization
  - Geometric diversity in local triangle configurations

**MUTATION TARGET**:
- Create structurally novel point arrangements through:
  - Spatial redistribution
  - Symmetry breaking
  - Local triangle shape manipulation
- Avoid clustered or degenerate configurations unless they are structurally justified (e.g. controlled near-collinear bands for tension)
