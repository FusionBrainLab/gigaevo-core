- **Triplet-aware spacing**: Prevent groups of 3 points from forming extremely small triangles by maintaining angular and spatial separation.

- **Asymmetric edge loading**: Place some points near triangle edges or corners, but break symmetry to prevent internal collapses.

- **Partial symmetry breaking**: Use near-symmetries (like mirrored arcs) distorted just enough to avoid degeneracies.

- **Angular robustness**: Favor obtuse or well-distributed triangle angles; avoid layouts where many triangles share a nearly collinear point.

- **Tension-based distribution**: Use repulsive spacing or progressive placement where high-risk triplets (likely to compress area) are pre-spaced early.

🚫 FAILURE MODES TO AVOID:
- Do **not** place multiple points exactly along a single triangle edge (→ collinear)
- Avoid placing many points at or near triangle **vertices** (→ stacked points)
- Prevent repeated (x, y) coordinates — even tiny shifts help prevent collapse

✅ TECHNIQUES TO REDUCE COLLAPSE:
- Add small spacing perturbations to edge-aligned or loop-generated points
- Check triangle areas during generation
- For edge or arc structures, **curve** the layout to break collinearity

📈 GOAL:
Push the **smallest triangle area upward** by trading symmetry for robustness and crafting **globally spread, locally stable** configurations.
