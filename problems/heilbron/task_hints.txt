💡 DESIGN HINTS FOR OPTIMAL POINT LAYOUT

- **Triplet-aware spacing**: Optimize for triangle robustness by preventing any group of 3 points from forming a very small or flat triangle. This requires angular as well as spatial separation.

- **Asymmetric edge loading**: It’s acceptable to place points near triangle edges or corners, but avoid doing so symmetrically — symmetry often creates repeating degeneracies in triangle area.

- **Broken symmetry beats perfect order**: Partial or near-symmetries (e.g., arcs or spirals) can be used, but they must be distorted or perturbed enough to avoid triplet collapses.

- **Angular robustness**: Favor configurations where triangle angles are diverse and well-spread. Avoid layouts where many triangles share a nearly collinear anchor point.

- **Tension-based distribution**: Use repulsion, local neighborhood shaping, or progressive placement schemes that space apart likely-degenerate triplets early in the generation process.

🚫 FAILURE MODES TO AVOID

- Do NOT align multiple points along a single triangle edge (→ collinearity → zero-area triangles)
- Avoid stacking many points at triangle vertices (→ high-density → degeneracies)
- Never reuse exact (x, y) coordinates — even small noise is better than duplication

✅ STRATEGIES TO PREVENT COLLAPSE

- Apply small perturbations to edge-aligned or patterned placements to break collinearity
- Consider triangle area quality during generation — reject or adjust placements that cause poor triplets
- When using arcs or edge-following structures, introduce curvature or angular irregularity to maintain triangle diversity

📈 GOAL

Construct a configuration where the **minimum triangle area among all point triplets is maximized**.  
Prioritize **triplet robustness** over symmetry. Trade geometric regularity for layouts that yield **globally spread, locally stable** triangles.
