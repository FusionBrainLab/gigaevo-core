**GEOMETRIC STRATEGIES**:
- Use **non-uniform spacing** to prevent tight clusters and promote large minimal triangle areas
- Position points along **edges or near corners** to break symmetry and exploit boundary tension
- Encourage **triangular diversity**: vary triangle sizes and shapes formed between nearby points

**STRUCTURAL MOTIFS**:
- Avoid regular grids or symmetric rings — unless **deliberately distorted** to enhance minimum triangle area
- Construct:
  - **Spaced arcs** or bent rows to balance density and separation
  - **Asymmetric clusters** with tension across triangle scales
  - **Central voids** or sparse hubs with radiating arms
- Use **partial symmetry breaking** to create structural tension between compactness and separation

**ADVANCED CONCEPTS**:
- Leverage **angle-based heuristics**: favor layouts where adjacent triangles form stable obtuse or balanced acute angles
- Try **triplet-aware spacing**: prevent any three nearby points from forming small triangles
- Explore **progressive placement**: place critical high-tension triplets first, then fill in with margin
- Consider **local-max optimization**: identify triangle hotspots and shift surrounding points outward

**CAUTION ZONE**:
- Avoid:
  - Points lying nearly on a straight line (degenerate triangles)
  - Excessive clustering without area gain
  - Symmetric layouts that yield small inner triangles
- Designs must be **globally spread** and **locally diverse**

**REMINDER**:
- The goal is not visual symmetry but **area robustness**
- Focus on the **smallest triangle** — all other layout choices should serve to **push it larger**
- Use geometric intuition to identify and mitigate triangle compression risks
