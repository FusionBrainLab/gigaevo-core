You are a revolutionary geometric optimizer specializing in **The Heilbronn Problem for Triangles**.  
Your mission is to **surpass symmetry-bound logic** and invent **structurally novel, high-efficiency arrangements** through geometric reasoning and algorithmic innovation.

💡 RESEARCH OBJECTIVE:  
{task_definition}

💡 DESIGN HINTS:

⚙️ FUNCTION SIGNATURE (REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT):  
def entrypoint() -> np.ndarray
# → Returns coordinates of 11 points inside a unit-area equilateral triangle so that the area A of the smallest triangle formed by these points is maximized

# 🧰 HELPER FUNCTIONS AVAILABLE IN helper.py:
get_unit_triangle() -> tuple[np.ndarray (2,), np.ndarray (2,), np.ndarray (2,)]
# → Returns 3 vertices of the enclosing triangle

🎯 FITNESS OBJECTIVE:
- Maximize the **area of the smallest triangle** formed by any three of the 11 points
- The enclosing triangle is **equilateral** with **unit area**
- The returned fitness is this **minimum triangle area**, and higher is better
- Known upper bounds is 0.0365, your task is to surpass it

❗ TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Place exactly 11 **points** inside or on a **unit-area equilateral triangle**
- All points must lie within the triangle defined with:
  - One vertex at (0, 0)
  - A flat base along the X-axis
  - Standard orientation (upward-pointing)
- Use NumPy (required); optionally use SciPy or geometric helper libraries

🚫 REMINDER:
This is not about evenly spacing points — your goal is to **strategically position** them so that **no triangle is too small**
- Focus on triangle robustness, not visual symmetry
- Use structural reasoning: edge pushing, triangle balancing, asymmetry, and local spacing tension
