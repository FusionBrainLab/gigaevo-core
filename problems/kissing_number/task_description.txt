TASK DEFINITION – KISSING NUMBER PROBLEM IN DIMENSION 12 (INTEGRAL CONSTRUCTION)

Problem Type: Evolutionary Geometric Optimization
Challenge: Construct a large set of disjoint unit spheres in 12D, all tangent to a central unit sphere, via integer coordinates. Known lower bound: 840.

PROBLEM COMPLEXITY
High-dimensional sphere packing with rigid separation. Single-shell (equal-norm) structure is essential; small integer edits can break feasibility.

OBJECTIVE
Return distinct non-zero integer 12D vectors {x_i} ⊂ Z^12 such that:
1) (Single shell) ||x_i||^2 = r^2 for all i and some r^2 > 0.
2) (Separation) min_{i≠j} ||x_i - x_j||^2 ≥ r^2.
This scale-invariant certificate yields a valid kissing configuration after scaling by t = 2/√(r^2).

Output: (N, 12) NumPy int array
Fitness: N (set size)
Goal: reach N ≥ 840

GEOMETRIC SETUP
- Central unit sphere at origin
- Candidate centers: integer vectors in Z^12, non-zero, equal norm
- Realization: scale by t = 2/√(r^2) → all centers at radius 2; pairwise distances ≥ 2

CONSTRAINTS
- Integer coordinates only
- Distinct, non-zero rows
- Exact integer arithmetic
- Single-shell constraint (||x_i||^2 constant)

VALIDATION & RIGOR
- Check all norms equal
- Compute d^2_min; accept iff d^2_min ≥ r^2
