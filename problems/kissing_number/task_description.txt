TASK DEFINITION – KISSING NUMBER PROBLEM IN DIMENSION 12 (INTEGRAL CONSTRUCTION)

Problem Type: Evolutionary Geometric Optimization
Challenge: Construct a large set of unit spheres in 12D, all mutually tangent and tangent to a central unit sphere, via integer coordinates. Known lower bound: 840.

PROBLEM COMPLEXITY
High-dimensional sphere packing with rigid separation constraints. The single-shell (equal-norm) structure is essential; even small integer edits can break feasibility.

OBJECTIVE
Return distinct non-zero integer 12D vectors {x_i} ⊂ Z^12 such that:
1) (Single shell) ||x_i||^2 = r^2 for all i and some r^2 > 0.
2) (Separation) min_{i≠j} ||x_i - x_j||^2 ≥ r^2.
This scale-invariant certificate yields a valid kissing configuration after scaling by t = 2/√(r^2).

Output: (N, 12) NumPy int array
Fitness: N (set size)
Goal: Achieve N ≥ 840

GEOMETRIC SETUP
- Central unit sphere at origin
- Candidate centers: integer vectors in Z^12, non-zero, equal norm
- Realization: scale by t = 2/√(r^2) → all centers at radius 2; pairwise distances ≥ 2

CONSTRAINTS
- Integer coordinates only
- Distinct, non-zero rows
- Exact integer arithmetic
- Single-shell constraint (||x_i||^2 constant)

VALIDATION & RIGOR
- Check all norms are equal
- Compute d²_min; accept iff d²_min ≥ r²

STRATEGIC GUIDANCE

Fitness Metric
Maximize N = number of distinct non-zero integer vectors x_i ∈ Z¹² satisfying:
    ||x_i||² = r² (constant) and min_{i≠j} ||x_i - x_j||² ≥ r²
(After rescaling by t = 2/√(r²), all centers lie on radius 2 with pairwise distances ≥ 2.)

Failure Modes
- Norm inconsistency (not single-shell)
- Certificate violation: d²_min < r²
- Duplicate vectors or inclusion of zero vector
- Symmetry duplicates (sign/permutation copies)
- Non-integer coordinates
- Float-based checks instead of exact integer arithmetic
- Timeouts due to direct combinatorial enumeration (e.g., generating all permutations or sign patterns) is computationally infeasible due to exponential complexity; use constructive or algebraic methods instead

Evaluation Details
- r² = ||x_i||² (common squared norm)
- d²_min = min_{i≠j} ||x_i - x_j||²
- Valid iff d²_min ≥ r²
- Fitness = N; secondary metric: margin δ = d²_min - r²
- Target: N ≥ 840
